Goal 1: esthetics
Goal 2: functionality

## Physical adaptations that can be induced by exercise
1. skill or technique
2. speed or velocity
3. power
    - strength times speed
4. strength or force
    - 1 rep max: how much you can move 1 time
5. muscle hypertrophy or size
6. muscular endurance
    - 5 to 25 repetitions in a row
    - localised to your muscle
7. anaerobic capacity
    - maximum HR
    - total physiological limitation
    - max work you can do in 30 to 45 sec, up to 120 sec of all-out work
    - interval type stuff
8. maximum aerobic capacity
    - reach max HR, improve VO2max
    - 8 to 15 min range
9. long duration or steady stade training or "cardio"
    - continued movement without any breaks or change
    - >15 min

Fat loss is not an adaptation but will be induced by the above. 

Training for one's health will require training for one of these 9 specific categories.

Others
- Typical resting Heart Rate: below 60 is the number to go for. 60 to 80 is OK

## Why having a balance is important
Example of a classic life-long endurance exercisers: their resting HR is going to be very low. 
But in terms of overall fitness, they are not strong.
The 2 types of muscle fiber (fast-twitch fibers vs slow-twitch). Fast-tiwtch are developed through strength training, Slow-twitch through endurance training.
Catching yourself when you fall requires fast-twitch fibers.
Each muscle have different mix.
Calf is mostly slow twitch
Harmstring is fast twitch
Quad is 50-50 although there are also hybrid fibers


## Tests to self-assess your fitness across the 

### skill
Gold standard:
Cost free equipment free:
join by joint
shoulder
elbow
hip
knee
ankle
-> record movement front view and side view 3-10 rep, slow controlled
lower body pull: deadlift
lower body push: squat
upper body pull: inclined row
upper body push: push up

look for:
1. symmetry
2. stability
3. awareness

What good looks like: can't do it at all - minor flaw - pretty good
What to do to improve:

### speed
Gold standard: 40 yard dash
Cost free equipment free: not necessary to test because covered by power
What good looks like
What to do to improve

### power
Gold standard
Cost free equipment free: simple broad jump (no running approach, measure the distance covered)
What good looks like: your height, a high performance athlete 6 feet tall will jump 9 feet
What to do to improve

classic vertical jump: use marker to mark on the wall with 2 hands, no running approach
what good looks like: 24 inches or higher, 20 inches if you're older

### strength
Gold standard
Cost free equipment free
What good looks like
What to do to improve

grip strength: hand grip meter device
look for assymetries left-right
minimum score of 40 kg, ideally past 60kg, no more variation than 10% between left and right

dead hang with whole handed grip
minimum of 30 seconds, 30 to 50 sec = good, 60 sec very good

leg extension test
minimum of 1 rep bodyweight, after 50s 10% decrease each decade

can use 1rep max estimation equation calculators with sets of up to 5 reps 

Goblet squat hold
minimum = 1/3rd of bodyweight for 30 seconds
very good = hold half of body weight for 45 seconds at the bottom of the squat and returning to the top

warm up protocol standardised

### muscle hypertrophy
Gold standard
Cost free equipment free
What good looks like
What to do to improve

body composition test
FFMI fat free mass index: 20 or higher for men, 18 for women. past 24-25 for men, it's a lot of muscle
use online calculator with : height, weight, fat percentage
under 17 FFMI for men is dangerous

### muscular endurance
Gold standard
Cost free equipment free
What good looks like
What to do to improve

front plank >60 sec
side plank >45 sec
push up 25+ consecutive push ups, 10 is minimal, sub 10 is red flag


### anaerobic capacity
Gold standard - wind gate test in laboratory
Cost free equipment free
What good looks like
What to do to improve

assault bike or field sprint for 30-45 sec
can you reach you max HR?
HR = 220 - age
recover 0.5 beat per second
within 60 seconds you should have recovered 30 beats
within next 60 seconds, you should recover 30 beats
within next 60 seconds, you should recover 30 beats

### aerobic capacity
Gold standard - VO2max test in lab
Cost free equipment free - 12 min cooper test
What good looks like - 1 mile to 2+ mile
What to do to improve

min 35, above 50 is good, above 55 is great 
"no human excuse to be below 60"

### steady state cardio
Gold standard
Cost free equipment free
What good looks like: min 20min, 30min straight minutes with nasal breathing without needed to take a break
What to do to improve

## org
test your worst
do full battery within 1 week (3 days split) once a year

Day 1:
- FFMI (non fatiguing) with 48 hours rest
- movement Tests

Day 2
- broad jump
- leg strength test -> leg extension, take 5 min break
- leg muscular endurance test -> roll back to 75% weight, do as much as you can

Day 3
- steady state cardio
- anaerobic test 

Day 4
- aerobic test
