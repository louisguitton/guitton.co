## Mobile debugging

Advanced mobile edge cases debugging using emulation
On your Mac, you can emulate iOS devices using XCode.

Setup:

Download XCode from Mac App Store (Warning: it's 12 GB, so better use Ethernet)
Add more devices to your Simulator like iPhone SE 1st generation : How to add simulator iPhone XS in Xcode 9.2 also iPhone XS max - Stack Overflow
Add older OS versions to you Simulator like iOS 14: Xcode/Simulator: How to run older iOS version? - Stack Overflow
Open the simulator with your device and OS of choice e.g. iOS 14 - iPhone XR: How do I run an iPad Simulator in Xcode? - Stack Overflow
Open the Safari browser in the Simulator and go to http://localhost:3000
Open the Safari browser on your Mac device, open the Developer tools connected to the Safari browser in the simulator. Now you should be able to use the Safari developer tools like in any other web page: see the DOM, set breakpoints for debugging, perform network analysis and much more.

> A short word of advice on learning. Learn the actual underlying technologies, before learning abstractions. Don't learn jQuery, learn the DOM. Don't learn SASS, learn CSS. Don't learn JSX, learn HTML. Don't learn TypeScript, learn JavaScript. Don't learn Handlebars, learn JavaScript ES6 templates. Don't just use Bootstrap, learn UI patterns.
